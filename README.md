## Running the Application

### Using `.bat` files (Windows — Recommended)

1. Edit `config.bat` with your MySQL credentials:
   ```batch
   set DB_USER=root
   set DB_PASS=your_mysql_password
   set MYSQL_SERVICE=MySQL80
   ```
2. Double-click **`start-springer.bat`** to start backend + frontend.
3. Double-click **`stop-springer.bat`** to stop all services.

App opens at **http://localhost:5173**

### Manual Setup

**Backend:**
```bash
cd springer
mvn clean install -DskipTests
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Runs on **http://localhost:8080** | Swagger: **http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html**

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd springer_frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Runs on **http://localhost:5173**

## Environment Profiles

| Profile | Active By | Purpose | Config File |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **prod** | Default (`application.properties`) | Production deployment | `application-prod.properties` |
| **test** | Maven test / IDE | H2 in-memory DB for unit tests | `application-test.properties` |
| **dev** | Override via `-Dspring.profiles.active=dev` | Development (if needed) | N/A (uses base config) |

## Port Configuration

| Service | Port | Override In |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Backend | 8080 | `config.bat` / `application.properties` |
| Frontend | 5173 | `config.bat` / `vite.config.ts` |
| MySQL | 3306 | `config.bat` |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start:**
- Ensure MySQL is running: `services.msc` → check `MySQL80` status
- Verify DB credentials in `config.bat` or `application.properties`
- Check port 8080 is not in use: `netstat -ano | findstr :8080`

**Frontend won't start:**
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
- Check port 5173 is not in use
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

**Database not created:**
- If mysql CLI not in PATH, manually create: `CREATE DATABASE Springer;`
- Verify MySQL credentials are correct

**"Hibernate ddl-auto update failed":**
- Ensure MySQL user has `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `INSERT` privileges
- Run: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON Springer.* TO 'root'@'localhost';`
